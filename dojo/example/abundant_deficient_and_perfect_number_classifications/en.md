These define three classifications of positive integers based on their proper divisors.
Let P(n) be the sum of the proper divisors of n, where the proper divisors of n are all positive divisors of n other than n itself.
if P(n) < n then n is classed as deficient (OEIS A005100).
if P(n) == n then n is classed as perfect (OEIS A000396).
if P(n) > n then n is classed as abundant (OEIS A005101).
Example: 6 has proper divisors 1, 2, and 3. 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 so 6 is classed as a perfect number.
Task
